# Installing

0. Install `rofi` from somewhere
1. Run `cargo build`
2. Edit `print-terminal.sh` to point to the right path
3. In your `.Xresources` set

    URxvt*print-pipe:                     "/home/apoelstra/bin/print-terminal.sh"

again, with the path corrected.

4. As you notice missing stuff, edit the source to add them and recompile
